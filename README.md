## Variational Encoder with Tensorflow

Variational Autoencoder

Dataset used -
1. Mnist 
2. Olivetti faces

#### Model

- VAE, a deep neural network is implemented with TF2.0.
- Input to model is noisy image and output is the same image without noise.
- Filter size is 16 followed by 32 and latent dimesion is 16 units.
- The loss function for training is mse.
